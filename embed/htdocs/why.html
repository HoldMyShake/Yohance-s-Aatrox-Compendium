	<p>Now after reading the About The Player, you may be thinking <b>"But why, Yohance? Why Aatrox, and why play him for that much?"</b></p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This champ's whole thing is healing. And in Season 11 it's just turned up to 11. The clip above shows just how absolutely <b>monsterous</b> Aatrox can be with a lead. I was basically in the middle of 5 enemies for 20 seconds and killing them all.</p>
<p>Also, Aatrox is probably the <b> most satisfying champion in this game.</b> The long cast times of his Qs just make it feel more satisfying and impactiful when the sweetspots do land.</p>
<p>Outside of gameplay, though, Aatrox has great voicelines. Shoutout to whoever did the voice acting.</p>

<p>And yeah, he's edgy and all, but he's at least lighthearted and funny with it.</p>
<p>Also a small thing but the Aatrox Mains community is pretty cool. r/AatroxMains and r/TheAatroxMains are just great places to be in. Not much toxicity and very high-quality shitposts.</p>
